### Project Scope:
The website will consist of five core webpages:

1. Homepage (index.html): This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.

2. About Page (about.html): This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.

3. Schedule Page (schedule.html): This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.

4. Register Page (register.html): This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.

5. Contact Page (contact.html): This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.

### Concepts Covered:

Throughout this project, you’ll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

- <strong>HTML Structure:</strong> You’ll solidify your understanding of fundamental HTML tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.

- <strong>Headings and Text:</strong> You’ll learn to structure headings (h1-h6) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (`<p>`) and other text formatting elements effectively.

- <strong>Links and Navigation:</strong> You’ll implement hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.

- <strong>Tables:</strong> You’ll create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.

- <strong>Forms:</strong> You’ll design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the `<form>` tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.

- <strong>Images and Multimedia:</strong> You’ll incorporate images (using `<img>`tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. You’ll also explore embedding a promotional video (using the `<video>` tag) and an interactive Google Map (using `<iframe>`) on the Contact page.
